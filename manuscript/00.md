# Intro

Doubtless, NgModules have always been one of the most controversial building blocks in Angular. While they allow to group elements that go together and hence provide a structure for your application, they also cause some redundancy as EcmaScript already comes with an own module system.

Beginning with Angular 14, NgModules are optional. The new Standalone Components are self-contained and hence make Angular development more lightweight. While the theory behind Standalone Components seems to be easy at first glance, it brings several questions: How to deal with routing and lazy loading? How to structure an application without NgModules? How to use existing NgModules-based code? 

In this small book, I try to answer all these questions. For this, I'm using an example that is as small as possible but also as big as needed to show the underlying ideas and concepts. At the end, I also provide some thoughts about migrating existing applications to Standalone Components.
